## Project Overview
The project aims to provide hands-on experience with hyperparameter tuning, an essential aspect of optimizing machine learning models. By leveraging Keras Tuner, participants will learn how to efficiently search and select the best hyperparameters for their neural network models. The project covers various hyperparameter tuning techniques, such as random search, grid search, and Bayesian optimization.
